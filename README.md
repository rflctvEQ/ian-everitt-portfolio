# My Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio. I've linked six of the projects I'm proudest of, my resume, and different ways to contact me. 

I have a number of future plans to improve the site. For example, I'd like to include more animations to enrich the UX, I'd like to use icons for my project buttons (rather than screenshots of the projects themselves), and I'd like to make the Contact section more like a footer rather than a dedicated section of the page. I'd also like to include functionality to allow people to contact me directly through my site. Furthermore, I think I'd like to dedicate a section in my portfolio to my philosophical endeavors, but I haven't yet found the best way to do that.
